# FiveM Kid Friendly Mod

Inspired by R3QQ's Family Friendly Free Roaming (FFFR) Mod for GTA 5 Single Player, this mod brings a safer/more age appropriate GTA experience for children to FiveM.

The mod includes many configurable features providing the opportunity to supress and remove all violent and disturbing encounters/game mechanics, effectively turning the game into a peaceful free-roam driving game, free of death, violence and injury, with the possibility of playing with friends and family.

# Features

All features can be turned on or off in the config, many have different options to tweak the feature to your liking.

Main features:

* Player and NPC invincibility, with gore and blood removed
* Players and NPCs cannot be run-down
* Removal of all weapons
* NPCs ignore players and are calmer in traffic (including cops)
* Carjacking replaced by NPCs willingly giving up their vehicle to you
* Removal of all inappropriate ped models
* Parental timer - set a max time the game can be played for, a timer will appear on the screen, on expiry the game will end

Extra features:

* Active player blips and visual markers

## FAQ

#### **Q1:** I have FiveM, but I don't have a server, can I use this mod?

**A1:** While it is possible to run scripts locally without a server enviorment, it's not recommended. Check out the following guides to get a local server set up on your PC (accessible by computers on your local network):

* Local server with split-screen/dual screen support:

* Local server only: [YouTube - video guide](https://youtu.be/YmW9K6GjY9w)

#### **Q2:** I have a FiveM server, can I use this script over the internet?

**A2:** Yes, it will work. But be warned, this script was intended for local host use and therefore does not employ any anti-cheat/hack preventions, given that this script is intended to provide a safe gaming experience for children, I highly recommend that you look into adding safety nets via third party script(s).
