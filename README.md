# FiveM Kid Friendly Mod

Inspired by [R3QQ's Family Friendly Free Roaming (FFFR)](https://sites.google.com/view/r3qq/family-friendly-free-roaming/fffr-3-0) mod for GTA 5 Single Player, this mod brings a safer/more age appropriate GTA experience for children to FiveM.

The mod includes many configurable features providing the opportunity to supress and remove all violent and disturbing encounters/game mechanics, effectively turning the game into a peaceful free-roam driving game, free of death, violence and injury, with the possibility of playing with friends and family.


## Features

All features can be turned on or off in the config, many have different options to tweak the feature to your liking.

Main features:

* Players and NPCs are invincible, with gore and blood removed
* Players and NPCs cannot be run-down
* Players and NPCs don't ragdoll (fall over)
* Removal of all weapons
* NPCs ignore Players and are calmer in traffic (including cops)
* Friendly carjacking - NPCs willingly leave their vehicle to the Player
* NPCs cannot carjack
* Removal of all inappropriate ped models
* All NPC speech is muted
* Parental timer - a parent can set a max time the game can be played for. A timer will appear on the screen, on expiry the game will end

Extra features:

* Simple trainer - with options to spawn vehicles, swap the player ped, change the weather, and more
* Teleport to other active players (hotkey or trainer)
* Active player blips and visual markers
* Teleport to waypoint (hotkey or trainer)
* Teleport to your last vehicle (hotkey)
* Clone vehicle (hotkey or trainer)
* Simple emote (hotkey) - plays one of several select emotes on each press

## FAQ

#### **Q1:** I have FiveM, but I don't run a server, can I use this mod?

**A1:** While it is possible to run scripts locally without a server enviorment, it's not recommended. Check out the following guides to get a local server set up on your PC (accessible by computers on your local network):

* Local server with split-screen/dual screen support:

    - [Reddit - written guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/t18dfa/comment/hyee5nd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
* Local server only: [YouTube - video guide](https://youtu.be/YmW9K6GjY9w)

#### **Q2:** I run a FiveM server, can I use this script online?

**A2:** Yes, it will work. But be warned, this script was intended for local host use and therefore does not employ any anti-cheat/hack preventions, given that this script is intended to provide a safe gaming experience for children, I highly recommend that you look into adding safety nets via a third party script(s).
